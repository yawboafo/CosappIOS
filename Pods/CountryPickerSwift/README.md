    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
       //get corrent country
        let locale = Locale.current
        let code = (locale as NSLocale).object(forKey: NSLocale.Key.countryCode) as! String?
        //init Picker
        picker.countryPickerDelegate = self
        picker.showPhoneNumbers = true
        picker.setCountry(code!)

    }
    
    // a picker item was selected
    func countryPhoneCodePicker(picker: CountryPicker, didSelectCountryWithName name: String, countryCode: String, phoneCode: String, flag: UIImage) {
       //pick up anythink
